- **Job Notification System**: Real-time SSE streaming and webhook notifications for async operations
- **Message Bundling**: Client-side 800ms message bundling to reduce API calls and server load
- **Agentic Loop Token Management**: Three-tier intelligent handling (detection, auto-switching, truncation) for token overflow
- **MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 Endpoint**: Standards-compliant `/mcp` endpoint for remote MCP client communication (now supporting 2024-11-05 specification)
- **Async Crawl4AI Polling**: Server-side WP-Cron polling for long-running crawl jobs with job status tracking

### Changed
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive updates to MCP-related documentation files
  - `docs/mcp-endpoint.md`: Added 2024-11-05 features, implementation status, and upgrade recommendations
  - `docs/MCP-AND-SSE.md`: Added Streamable HTTP transport info, protocol enhancements, and migration guide
  - `docs/mcp-server-authentication.md`: Added OAuth 2.1 security enhancements section
  - `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`: Updated with MCP version and enhanced documentation references
  - `README.md`: Added MCP version badge and enhanced MCP section with 2024-11-05 features
- Chat interface now provides visual feedback for message bundling ("Preparing to send…", "Sending…")
- Token overflow scenarios automatically switch to higher-capacity models (gpt-4o-mini → Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- SSE endpoint modernized with automatic reconnection, event IDs, and HTTP/2 compatibility

### Fixed
- **PHP Version Compatibility**: Added defensive PHP version checks to all WooCommerce-related files to prevent parse errors on PHP < 7.4. This ensures that if any WooCommerce logging or error handling mechanism attempts to load plugin files directly, they will gracefully exit instead of causing "unexpected token private/protected" fatal errors on older PHP versions.
- JavaScript lint errors: Fixed 6 linting errors including unused function parameters in admin-settings.js and camelcase identifier warnings in settings-dashboard.js
- JavaScript lint error for unused `waitForCrawl4aiTask` function (documented as reserved for future use)
- 164 PHP coding standard violations auto-fixed across 19 files
- Tool registry validation ensuring correct slug-to-class mappings

## [1.0.0] – 2025-10-23
### Changed
- Expanded chat interaction logging to keep structured message content while trimming oversized payloads.
- Front-end chat client now preserves assistant replies that contain non-text content like images or tool results.
- Bundled the ChatKit integration directly inside the core plugin, replacing the standalone add-on workflow.

## [0.9.0] – 2025-10-21
### Added
- Initial beta release
- AI Assistant custom post type
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- REST chat endpoint `/wp-json/mcp-ai/v1/chat`
- Tool registry with default tools
- WooCommerce & JetEngine conditional tools
- Admin settings for API key
- Shortcode `[mcp_ai_chat assistant="ID"]`

### Notes
- Stable for development & testing.
- Production hardening will follow post-feedback.
