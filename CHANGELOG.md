### Changed
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive updates to MCP-related documentation files
  - `docs/mcp-endpoint.md`: Added 2024-11-05 features, implementation status, and upgrade recommendations
  - `docs/MCP-AND-SSE.md`: Added Streamable HTTP transport info, protocol enhancements, and migration guide
  - `docs/mcp-server-authentication.md`: Added OAuth 2.1 security enhancements section
  - `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`: Updated with MCP version and enhanced documentation references
  - `README.md`: Added MCP version badge and enhanced MCP section with 2024-11-05 features
  - `docs/jetengine-api-compatibility.md`: New comprehensive guide for JetEngine API compatibility
  - `docs/deployment-troubleshooting.md`: Added JetEngine v3.3+ compatibility troubleshooting
- Chat interface now provides visual feedback for message bundling ("Preparing to send…", "Sending…")
- Token overflow scenarios automatically switch to higher-capacity models (gpt-4o-mini → Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- SSE endpoint modernized with automatic reconnection, event IDs, and HTTP/2 compatibility

### Fixed
- **JetEngine API Compatibility**: Fixed fatal error "Call to undefined method Item_Handler::query_items()" when using JetEngine 3.3+
  - Updated Performance Monitor CCT to use new db->query() API with fallback to old Item_Handler API
  - Updated Performance Reporter to use compatibility layer
  - Updated Elementor performance widgets to use compatibility layer
  - Added comprehensive test suite (12 tests) for query compatibility
- **PHP Version Compatibility**: Added defensive PHP version checks to all WooCommerce-related files to prevent parse errors on PHP < 7.4. This ensures that if any WooCommerce logging or error handling mechanism attempts to load plugin files directly, they will gracefully exit instead of causing "unexpected token private/protected" fatal errors on older PHP versions.
- **LM Studio & Ollama Timeout Issues**: Fixed "WordPress timed out waiting for a response" errors for local AI providers
  - Increased minimum timeout for completion requests from 30s to 120s
  - Resource Manager now allows bypassing PHP `max_execution_time` constraint for external HTTP requests
  - Local AI models can now take the time they need (60-240s+) without timing out
  - Timeout can be further increased via Settings → WP oOS → Request Timeout if needed【F:includes/class-resource-manager.php†L189-L220】【F:includes/class-wp-mcp-ai-ollama-client.php†L111-L119】【F:includes/class-wp-mcp-ai-lm-studio-client.php†L253-L261】
- JavaScript lint errors: Fixed 6 linting errors including unused function parameters in admin-settings.js and camelcase identifier warnings in settings-dashboard.js
- JavaScript lint error for unused `waitForCrawl4aiTask` function (documented as reserved for future use)
- 164 PHP coding standard violations auto-fixed across 19 files
- Tool registry validation ensuring correct slug-to-class mappings
