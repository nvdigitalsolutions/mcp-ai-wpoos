# NV oOS Dependabot Loop — Alert Triage, Safe Bumps & Dismissal

Playbook for the recurring Dependabot sweep in this repo, distilled from the
executed 2026-09-30 run (PR #6817: js-yaml + webpack-dev-middleware bumps;
alerts 803/804, 898, 901, 922–976 triaged; issues #6647/#6818). It covers the
full loop: discovery → forensics → fix decision → lockfile regen → dismissal →
issue housekeeping → CI triage. The workflow implements Dependabot's own
dismissal semantics (`fix_started` vs `tolerable_risk`) adapted to this repo's
alpha-working → main merge flow.

## When to use this skill

- The user asks to "fix the dependabot alerts", "close out dependabot issues",
  "bump vulnerable npm packages", or resumes a previous dependabot sweep.
- You see a PR/CI run titled like `Bump <pkg> to patched versions`.
- A `security/dependabot` dashboard link is pasted with an alert list or CI log.

## Step 0 — Orientation (before touching anything)

1. **Check existing work first** (multi-agent rule from `AGENTS.md`): `git branch -a`
   for `dependabot/*` branches and `gh issue list --search dependabot` for
   tracking issues. The 2026-09-11 sweep used `dependabot/npm-safe-bumps` and
   `dependabot/safe-bumps-batch`; do not duplicate scopes they already fixed
   (sharp, nodemailer, joi, postcss-selector-parser).
2. **Alerts are computed against the DEFAULT branch (`main`), not
   `alpha-working`.** Fixes committed to `alpha-working` (the active v1.1.x
   line) do not clear an alert until they merge to `main`. Never dismiss an
   alert as "fixed" without verifying `main`'s lockfiles (Step 2).
3. Branch from `origin/alpha-working` (not `main`) for all new work; PR base is
   `alpha-working` (Step 5).

## Step 1 — Alert discovery

Aggregate the open alerts by package + manifest (dedupes the ~10 undici GHSA
variants that each hit 4 manifests):

```sh
gh api repos/nvdigitalsolutions/mcp-ai-wpoos/dependabot/alerts --paginate --jq '
  [.[] | select(.state == "open")]
  | group_by(.security_vulnerability.package.name + "|" + .dependency.manifest_path)
  | map({package: .[0].security_vulnerability.package.name,
         ecosystem: .[0].security_vulnerability.package.ecosystem,
         manifest: .[0].dependency.manifest_path,
         patched: .[0].security_vulnerability.first_patched_version.identifier,
         count: length, alerts: map(.number)})
  | sort_by(.manifest + .package)'
```

For one alert's advisory details: `gh api .../dependabot/alerts/{n}` and read
`security_vulnerability.vulnerable_version_range`,
`security_vulnerability.first_patched_version.identifier`, and
`security_advisory.description` (the description names the affected code path —
e.g. GHSA-866g-f22w-33x8 names `createJsonResponseHandler`).

**Multi-line advisory gotcha (the 2026-10-03 undici family):** the alert's
top-level `security_vulnerability` exposes only ONE vulnerable range, but recent
advisories declare several — one per supported major line, each with its own
patch. Read the full `security_advisory.vulnerabilities[]` array, not just the
top-level field. The undici family published 2026-09-29 patches three lines at
once: `6.x → 6.28.1`, `7.x → 7.29.1`, `8.x → 8.10.2`. The Step 1 aggregate
dedupes by the single-range `first_patched_version`, so a manifest whose top
copy is patched can still hide a vulnerable copy on another major line — always
check every copy against every range (a three-line range checker is in the
2026-10-03 triage below).

## Step 2 — Staleness forensics (which alerts are real?)

Dependabot's state machine only auto-transitions alerts to `fixed` when the
default branch is clean, and re-scans lag pushes. So verify versions yourself.

**A. Scan the local lockfiles** (21 npm trees as of 2026-10-03 — root + 20
addons, each with its own `package-lock.json`; the set grows, so `find_path` for
`**/package-lock.json` first):

```sh
node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const files=['package-lock.json','addons/pro/package-lock.json','addons/pro/assets/spa/package-lock.json','addons/pro/assets/spa-v2/package-lock.json','addons/chat-spa/package-lock.json','addons/cloud-worker/package-lock.json','addons/cloudways-dashboard/package-lock.json','addons/saas-controller/package-lock.json','addons/toolkit-shell/package-lock.json','addons/docs-hub/package-lock.json','addons/media-studio/package-lock.json','addons/media-worker/package-lock.json','addons/canvas-toolkit/package-lock.json','addons/comic-reader/package-lock.json','addons/document-editor/package-lock.json','addons/funiq-bridge/package-lock.json','addons/librechat/package-lock.json','addons/page-agent/package-lock.json','addons/schedule-anything-spa/package-lock.json','addons/tenant-router/package-lock.json','addons/mcp-wordpress-gateway/package-lock.json']; const names=['js-yaml','undici','webpack-dev-middleware','body-parser','qs','@ai-sdk/provider-utils']; for(const f of files){ if(!fs.existsSync(f)) continue; const l=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8')); const pk=l.packages||{}; for(const p in pk){ const n=p.split('node_modules/').pop(); if(names.includes(n)) console.log(f,'|',p,'|',pk[p].version); } }"
```

Multi-line range checker (flags any copy inside any undici advisory range; adapt
the thresholds per package):

```sh
node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const files=['addons/media-worker/package-lock.json']; const vuln=(v)=>{ if(/^6\./.test(v)) return v<'6.28.1'; if(/^7\./.test(v)) return v<'7.29.1'; if(/^8\./.test(v)) return v<'8.10.2'; return false; }; for(const f of files){ const pk=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8')).packages||{}; for(const p in pk){ if(p.endsWith('node_modules/undici') && vuln(pk[p].version)) console.log('VULNERABLE', f, p, pk[p].version); } }"
```

Print the **full path** (not just the name) — multiple copies of the same
package can coexist (e.g. `node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware@6.1.3` for
react-cosmos next to `node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/webpack-dev-middleware@8.0.3`),
and only some copies may sit in the vulnerable range.

**B. Verify the DEFAULT branch state** for any alert you plan to dismiss as
stale. The contents API truncates files >1 MB (silently! — JSON.parse then
fails with "Unexpected end of JSON input"), so fetch with the raw media type:

```sh
gh api "repos/nvdigitalsolutions/mcp-ai-wpoos/contents/addons/pro/package-lock.json?ref=main" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" > /tmp/check.json
```

**C. Classify** each alert group:
- **Stale** — patched version already present in the relevant lockfile(s)
  (default branch or the branch carrying the fix). No code change; these
  auto-dismiss after the fix reaches `main` (or dismiss manually, Step 7).
- **Genuinely vulnerable** — a copy inside `vulnerable_version_range` exists.
  Proceed to Step 3–4.
- **Stale-graph false positive** — the alert fired against an outdated
  dependency-graph snapshot even though the CURRENT default-branch lockfile is
  already patched. Seen 2026-10-03: 7 media-worker undici alerts fired
  2026-10-02 against `main`'s already-clean lockfile (7.29.1/6.28.1 patched by
  PR #6806, in `main` since the v1.1.92 squash merge of 2026-10-01 — before the
  alerts were created). Verify `main` directly (Step 2B) before assuming an
  alert is real; if the manifest is clean on `main`, dismiss as `inaccurate`
  with the evidence in the comment. Don't expect a re-scan to clear these until
  the next push to `main`.

2026-09-30 example: `undici` (31 alerts), gateway `body-parser`/`qs` were
stale on `alpha-working` but still vulnerable on `main` (`undici@8.10.0`,
`body-parser@1.20.3`, `qs@6.13.0`) — the fixes were already committed to
alpha-working v1.1.89 and only needed the merge. `js-yaml@5.2.x` and
`webpack-dev-middleware@8.0.3` were genuinely vulnerable everywhere.

## Step 3 — Registry checks before any bump

- Confirm the patched version exists: `npm view <pkg> versions --json`.
- Find who depends on it and which ranges they declare:

```sh
node -e "const l=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('package-lock.json','utf8')); const pk=l.packages||{}; for(const p in pk){ const d=pk[p].dependencies; if(d && d['<pkg>']) console.log(p,'->',d['<pkg>']); }"
```

This tells you whether the override is moving an in-major patch (safe) or
crossing a major for some consumer (e.g. `@langchain/classic` genuinely
requires `js-yaml@^5.2.2`; eslint declares `^4.1.0` but had already been forced
onto 5.x by the prior override).

## Step 4 — Fix decision tree

### A. In-major override bump (the common case)

When the vulnerable copy is already on a major line and the patched version is
a patch bump, raise the existing `overrides` value in each affected
`package.json` (e.g. `"js-yaml": ">=4.3.0"` → `">=5.4.1"`) and regenerate the
lockfiles (Step 6). No dependency ranges change; only the override.

Floor-raise variant (the 2026-10-01 fast-uri run, PR #6834): when the advisory's
vulnerable range is a *minor* inside the override's major (`>= 4.1.3, < 4.1.5`
vs the `>=4.1.4` floor), just raise the floor (`>=4.1.4` → `>=4.1.5`, resolving
4.2.1) — same lockfile-only diff, but run the npm-pack `index.d.ts` diff anyway
(it showed an additive optional `ipv6Zone` field only) and cite it in the PR.

Bounded-floor variant (the 2026-10-03 markdown-it run, PR #6868): when the
advisory's patched line is a minor bump but the **next major exists and is
undesired**, bound the override — `">=14.2.0"` → `">=14.3.1 <15"` across the
three trees (root, `addons/pro/assets/spa`, `addons/saas-controller`) so npm
stays on 14.x (an unbounded floor resolved to 15.0.2). Same discipline:
npm-pack diff the minor (14.3.0 → 14.3.1: internal rule/helper files + dist
bundles only, no `lib/index.mjs` delta), note the consumer is dev-only tooling
(`@wordpress/scripts` → `markdownlint-cli` → `markdown-it`, linkify off —
availability-only advisory, medium severity), and remember sibling-alert notes
(the 9 jsdom-nested undici alerts clear only when `alpha-working` merges to
`main`; media-worker undici alerts are stale-graph false positives).

### B. Scoped override (`@version` syntax) — do not force unrelated majors

A blanket override (`"webpack-dev-middleware": ">=8.3.0"`) applies to ALL
copies — it ripped react-cosmos-plugin-webpack's `webpack-dev-middleware@6.1.3`
up to 8.x. Scope it instead, matching the repo's existing `minimatch@^3` style:

```json
"webpack-dev-middleware@^8": ">=8.3.0"
```

Only use a plain key when the tree has a single copy (e.g.
`addons/pro/assets/spa`).

### C. Major / API-breaking bumps — prove it, then defer to an issue

When the patched version is a different major (or the fixed range excludes the
whole installed line), **verify API compatibility before overriding**:

1. `npm pack <pkg>@<old>` and `npm pack <pkg>@<new>` in a scratch dir; untar.
2. Grep the **consumers'** dist for what they call on the package
   (`grep -o "import_<pkg>[0-9]*\.[A-Za-z0-9_]*" .../dist/index.js | sort -u`),
   then diff those symbols' signatures between the two `index.d.ts`.
3. **Watch for sync → async changes specifically** — a function returning a
   value vs a Promise is the classic silent breaker.

Case study (the `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` alerts, left open): ui-utils 1.2.11
calls `safeParseJSON({text})` synchronously in the useChat stream parser and
react 1.2.12 calls `safeValidateTypes()` synchronously; both became
Promise-returning in provider-utils 3.x, so an override silently breaks chat
streaming. The entire 2.x line is vulnerable (no backport), so the only fix is
the `@ai-sdk/react` 1.x → 2.x migration — file a tracking issue instead
(Step 8). Never ship an override you have not verified against the consumer's
call sites.

Case study — a verified-safe cross-major bump that SHIPPED (the 2026-10-01
nodemailer run, PR #6833): the advisory's patched range (`>= 10.0.9`) excluded
the whole installed 9.x line, so this was a major migration in `addons/pro` +
`addons/media-worker`. It shipped because the proof was strong:

1. npm-pack diff showed the mailparser deep-import
   (`nodemailer/lib/addressparser`) still resolves through nodemailer 10's
exports map as a callable CJS export.
2. A/B-testing 9.1.1 vs 10.0.9 on quoted local-part / group / encoded-name /
   plain inputs was **byte-identical** (and 10.x preserves the quoted local
   part, which is the advisory's required behavior).
3. nodemailer 10 has zero runtime deps and requires Node ≥ 20 — the
   media-worker sidecar already runs `node:22-alpine`; CI passes
   `--ignore-engines` on the 18/20 matrix (EBADENGINE warnings only).

**Vendor-bundle gotcha specific to this repo:** nodemailer 10 ships **no
top-level `lib/`** — the `copy-dependencies.js` vendor copy spec had to switch
from copying `lib/` to copying `dist/`, and `assets/vendor/nodemailer` was
refreshed 8.0.5 → 10.0.9 with the old `lib/` removed so vulnerable code is
never distributed. When a major bump touches a package this repo vendors
(`copy-dependencies.js` + `assets/vendor/`), updating the copy spec + bundle is
part of the fix — a lockfile-only bump leaves the vulnerable vendored code in
the tree.

### D. Stale alerts — no code change

Document them in the PR/commit body and let Dependabot re-scan (or dismiss
with `fix_started` referencing the branch that already carries the fix).

## Step 5 — Branch, commit, PR conventions

- Branch: `dependabot/<packages>-safe-bumps` from `origin/alpha-working`;
  PR base `alpha-working`.
- Commit subject ≤ 50 chars, imperative, e.g.
  `Bump js-yaml and webpack-dev-middleware to patched versions`. Body lists the
  alert numbers + GHSA IDs resolved, and calls out what was left open and why.
- Create the PR with `gh pr create --base alpha-working --head <branch>` (the
  `create_pull_request` MCP tool may lack credentials — fall back to `gh`).

## Step 6 — Lockfile regen & validation

For every `package.json` you changed (root + addons):

```sh
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
```

- `addons/pro` **must** use `--legacy-peer-deps` (its lockfile is generated
  that way by the root `postinstall`).
- `--package-lock-only` avoids touching `node_modules`; `--ignore-scripts`
  avoids the root `postinstall` recursion.
- Expect benign churn: npm re-resolves transitive ranges against the current
  registry and syncs the lockfile's stale root `version` field. Accept it; the
  repo's own history has "regenerate lock file with full dependency tree"
  commits.
- Validate each tree: `npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`
  must pass in all 13 directories before pushing.
- Verify the final state with the Step 2A scanner — every previously
  vulnerable copy must be at/above `first_patched_version`.

## Step 7 — Alert dismissal (close-out)

When asked to close out the dashboard, dismiss with honest reasons via
`gh api` (50 PATCH calls in a sh `for` loop is fine; rate limit is 5000/hr):

```sh
gh api -X PATCH "repos/nvdigitalsolutions/mcp-ai-wpoos/dependabot/alerts/$n" \
  -f state=dismissed \
  -f dismissed_reason=fix_started \
  -f dismissed_comment="Fix in PR #6817; applies once alpha-working merges to main." \
  --jq '"dismissed \(.number)"'
```

Reason mapping:

| Reason | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `fix_started` | Fix exists in a PR or on `alpha-working`, awaiting merge to `main` |
| `tolerable_risk` | Accurate but accepted; a tracking issue documents the plan (e.g. the AI SDK migration → #6647) |
| `inaccurate` / `not_used` / `no_bandwidth` | Alert wrong / package unused / no capacity — rare in this repo |

Always put the PR number or issue number in `dismissed_comment`. Then verify:

```sh
gh api repos/nvdigitalsolutions/mcp-ai-wpoos/dependabot/alerts --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.state == "open")] | length' | \
  node -e "let t=0;process.stdin.on('data',c=>t+=parseInt(c)||0).on('end',()=>console.log('open:',t))"
```

**Caveat to state in the report:** dismissal is permanent, but `main` stays
vulnerable until alpha-working merges — call that out and recommend the merge.

## Step 8 — GitHub issue housekeeping

- **Search before filing**: `gh issue list --search dependabot` — the AI SDK
  migration already had issue #6647 before the sweep filed #6818; close the
  duplicate (`gh issue close <n> --reason duplicate`) and copy the analysis
  into the canonical issue as a comment.
- One canonical tracker per deferred major migration; the dismissal comment
  references it.
- Unrelated issues that merely *mention* a dependabot PR (e.g. #6366) are out
  of scope — leave them.

## Step 9 — CI triage (known failure modes)

- **`npm error EEXIST ... /home/runner/.npm/_cacache/tmp/<hex>`** — transient
  npm cache race on GitHub runners (npm/cli#7447), not a lockfile problem.
  Re-run the job: `gh run list --branch <b> --workflow "JavaScript Tests"` then
  `gh run watch <databaseId> --exit-status`. Note: the display number (e.g.
  #17610) is NOT the API id — `gh run watch 17610` 404s; use `databaseId`.
- **`npm warn EBADENGINE`** (webpack-dev-server@6, http-proxy-middleware@4,
  p-retry@8 want node ≥ 22 while the matrix runs 18/20) — warnings only, the
  job passes `--ignore-engines`. Pre-existing; a Node 22/24 matrix bump is a
  separate change.

## Gotchas (this repo, Windows git-bash)

- Default shell is `sh`: no `dir`, no `bc` (use `ls`, node arithmetic).
- `/tmp` written by sh resolves to git-bash's `/tmp`, but node.exe sees
  `F:\tmp` — use repo-relative paths for handoffs between the two. Best of all:
  pipe `gh api` raw output straight into `node -e` on stdin and skip temp files.
- Older `gh` versions have no `-o/--output` flag on `gh api` — redirecting with
  `-o /tmp/x.json` fails with "unknown shorthand flag"; use `| node` instead.
- GitHub contents API: >1 MB files need
  `-H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"` (see Step 2B).
- The root `package-lock.json` carries a stale `version` until regen — the
  diff will always include that sync line; do not hand-edit it out.
- `npm ci --dry-run` does not touch node_modules; it only proves
  `package.json`/lockfile consistency — the real install happens in CI.
