# JetFormBuilder: action — read form data, call external API, write result back

Most custom JFB actions follow the same data-flow shape: pull values out of the submitted form, optionally interpolate admin-typed templates with `%field%` macros, hit an external HTTP API, transform the response, write it back into the form context so downstream actions can read it, and (optionally) dispatch a custom JFB event based on the outcome to fan out to conditional follow-up actions.

This skill covers that full lifecycle inside `do_action()`. It complements **`jfb-form-action`** (which covers the action class structure) and **`jfb-action-events`** (which covers event dispatch). This one is specifically about the **PHP-side data flow** — the API surface JFB exposes for read/write/macro/dispatch from inside an action.

## API stability note

The `jet_fb_context()` global (with `get_value`, `update_request`, `has_field`, `resolve_request`), `Tools::sanitize_text_field()`, and the `Tab_Handler_Manager::instance()->options( $tab_id )` accessor have been stable across JFB 3.x in source observed. The WordPress HTTP API (`wp_remote_post`, `wp_remote_retrieve_body`, `WP_Error` handling) is WP core. The `plugin-version-tested` value records last end-to-end verification.

## When to use this skill

- A custom action calls a third-party HTTP API as part of its work.
- An action needs to read multiple form fields and interpolate them into a request body or instructions string.
- The admin should be able to write templates like `"Verify %email% for order %order_id%"` and have JFB substitute the field values.
- The API response should be written back into the form context so other actions can use it (for example, a "ChatGPT Decision" action writing the answer into a hidden form field that a "Send Email" action then includes).
- The action should branch the action chain based on the API response (success/failure/decision).
- The diff/files contain `jet_fb_context()`, `update_request`, `wp_remote_post`, `wp_remote_retrieve_body`, `WP_Error`, or macro substitution patterns like `%[a-z_]+%`.

## Architecture in one paragraph

JFB exposes the live form submission as a singleton via `jet_fb_context()`. From inside `do_action( array $request, Action_Handler $handler )`, the `$request` parameter is an associative array of field IDs to current values, but the **same data is also available** through `jet_fb_context()->get_value( $field_id )` — and the context is the source of truth: subsequent actions read from it. To **write** a value back (so downstream actions see it), call `jet_fb_context()->update_request( $value, $field_id )`. Admin-typed templates with `%field%` placeholders are interpolated by a small replacer that calls `jet_fb_context()->has_field()` and `get_value()`. External API calls go through WordPress's HTTP API (`wp_remote_post` etc.) with proper timeout, header, and error handling — never `file_get_contents` or `curl_*` directly. API credentials come from the plugin's settings tab via `Tab_Handler_Manager::instance()->options( $tab_id )`. Outcome branching is done by dispatching a custom event through `jet_fb_events()->execute( EventClass::class, $form_id )` — this fans out the chain without the action knowing which followups exist.

## Step 1 — read the form data

There are two correct ways to read a field's submitted value, with different semantics:

```php
public function do_action( array $request, Action_Handler $handler ) {
    $email = $request['email_field_id'] ?? '';                 // direct from request
    $email = jet_fb_context()->get_value( 'email_field_id' );  // through context
}
```

**Use `$request[...]`** when reading values that won't be changed by previous actions in the chain (most common case — submitted-as-is data).

**Use `jet_fb_context()->get_value( $field_id )`** when:
- A previous action might have called `update_request()` to mutate a value (e.g. a translation action overwriting a field with a translated copy).
- You want to write back later — for symmetry, read through the same API.
- You want to fall through `has_field()` cleanly when the field doesn't exist on the form.

`get_value()` returns the current context value (post any updates). `$request` is the snapshot passed to your `do_action`. They diverge only when intermediate actions mutate; if you control the chain, both work. If in doubt, **prefer the context API** — it's the source of truth.

## Step 2 — sanitize and validate

Form data has been validated by JFB's field rules but **NOT sanitized for your specific output target**. Your action is responsible for sanitization that fits how the data leaves your code.

```php
$email = sanitize_email( (string) $email );
if ( ! is_email( $email ) ) {
    throw new Action_Exception(
        __( 'Provided email is not valid.', 'myplugin' )
    );
}

// For text passed to an external API (no HTML expected):
$instructions = sanitize_textarea_field( $this->settings['instructions'] ?? '' );

// For values that act as identifiers (no whitespace, no special chars):
$external_id = Tools::sanitize_text_field( $request['external_id'] ?? '' );

// For numeric IDs:
$user_id = absint( $request['user_id'] ?? 0 );
```

`Tools::sanitize_text_field()` is JFB's wrapper that trims plus does the standard `sanitize_text_field` work. Use it for action settings that the user typed in the editor.

## Step 3 — macro replacement (`%field_id%` in admin templates)

A common pattern: the admin types a template like `"Hi %first_name%, your order %order_id% is ready"` in an action setting, and you substitute the form's actual field values at runtime. The replacer reads `jet_fb_context()` so it stays in sync with any mutations from upstream actions.

```php
private function replace_macros( string $template ): string {
    if ( false === strpos( $template, '%' ) ) {
        return $template;
    }

    return preg_replace_callback(
        '/%(?P<name>[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+)%/',
        static function ( $match ) {
            $field = $match['name'];

            if ( ! jet_fb_context()->has_field( $field ) ) {
                return $match[0]; // leave the placeholder as-is
            }

            $value = jet_fb_context()->get_value( $field );

            if ( is_array( $value ) || is_object( $value ) ) {
                $value = wp_json_encode( $value );
            }

            return (string) $value;
        },
        $template
    );
}
```

Notes:

- **Regex matches `[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+`** for the macro name — adjust if your field IDs allow other characters, but JFB field IDs are normally constrained to this set.
- **Skip the early-out (`strpos`) at your peril** — without it, every empty-template render runs a regex pass.
- **Unknown macro is left literal**, not stripped. The admin should see `%not_a_field%` in the output if they typo'd, not silently nothing.
- **Array / object values get JSON-encoded** because they have to become a string. If your context expects something else (CSV, comma-joined), customize the inner branch.
- **The macro replacer is `static`** — it has no instance state. Make it a private method or a free function.

JFB ships its own macro / preset / dynamic-value subsystems for richer cases (date formatters, computed values, related-post lookups). If your needs grow past simple field substitution, look into `jet_fb_dynamic_value()` or the macros module instead of expanding this regex.

## Step 4 — call the external API (WP HTTP API)

Always use `wp_remote_*` — never `file_get_contents`, `curl_init`, `fopen` for HTTP. WordPress's HTTP API handles transport selection, proxy config, SSL verify, and timeout consistently across hosts.

```php
private function call_external_api( array $payload ): array {
    $settings = $this->get_api_settings();
    $api_key  = trim( (string) ( $settings['api_key'] ?? '' ) );

    if ( '' === $api_key ) {
        throw new Action_Exception(
            __( 'API key is missing. Configure it in the plugin settings.', 'myplugin' )
        );
    }

    $response = wp_remote_post(
        'https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint',
        array(
            'headers' => array(
                'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $api_key,
                'Content-Type'  => 'application/json',
                'Accept'        => 'application/json',
            ),
            'body'    => wp_json_encode( $payload ),
            'timeout' => 30,
        )
    );

    if ( $response instanceof \WP_Error ) {
        throw new Action_Exception(
            sprintf(
                /* translators: %s: HTTP error message */
                __( 'API request failed: %s', 'myplugin' ),
                $response->get_error_message()
            )
        );
    }

    $code = (int) wp_remote_retrieve_response_code( $response );
    $body = (string) wp_remote_retrieve_body( $response );

    if ( $code < 200 || $code >= 300 ) {
        throw new Action_Exception(
            sprintf(
                /* translators: 1: HTTP status code, 2: response body excerpt */
                __( 'API returned %1$d: %2$s', 'myplugin' ),
                $code,
                wp_strip_all_tags( substr( $body, 0, 200 ) )
            )
        );
    }

    $decoded = json_decode( $body, true );
    if ( ! is_array( $decoded ) ) {
        throw new Action_Exception(
            __( 'API returned a non-JSON response.', 'myplugin' )
        );
    }

    return $decoded;
}
```

Critical points:

- **`timeout`** — set explicitly. WP default is 5 seconds which is too short for many APIs. 30 seconds is reasonable for most LLM/CRM calls; raise only if you know the upstream is slower.
- **`headers`** — always include `Content-Type` for POST bodies, and `Accept` for clarity. `Authorization` for any auth scheme.
- **`body`** — `wp_json_encode`, never plain `json_encode` (the WP wrapper handles charsets and edge cases).
- **`WP_Error` handling** — `wp_remote_*` returns either an array on success OR a `WP_Error` on transport failure. Always check.
- **HTTP status code** — `wp_remote_retrieve_response_code` is the canonical way to read it. Convert to int, check the 2xx range. A 200-OK with malformed body still throws below.
- **Body excerpt in error message** — `substr( $body, 0, 200 )` + `wp_strip_all_tags` keeps user-visible errors short and HTML-safe. Don't dump the full body — APIs sometimes return huge HTML error pages.
- **Throw `Action_Exception`, not `Exception`** — JFB only translates `Action_Exception` to user-facing messages.

For **SSRF protection** when the URL is admin-configurable (e.g. webhook URLs the user types in), additionally validate the URL host against an allowlist or use the `reject_unsafe_urls` request arg. See `wp-security-deep` for the full SSRF discussion.

## Step 5 — write the result back into form context

When your action produces data that downstream actions should see (e.g. ChatGPT writes its answer into a hidden field, a translation action replaces a value with its translated form), use `update_request`:

```php
$answer = $api_response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] ?? '';
$answer = sanitize_textarea_field( $answer );

jet_fb_context()->update_request( $answer, $target_field_id );
```

Key semantics:

- **`update_request( $value, $field_id )`** — argument order is `(value, field_id)`, NOT `(field_id, value)`. Easy to flip.
- **Writing to a non-existent field is silent** — the value is stored and `has_field` will return true after, but nothing visible in the form. To verify before writing, call `has_field` first.
- **Subsequent actions read the new value** via both `$request[ $field_id ]` (their `do_action`'s `$request` is re-resolved from context) AND `jet_fb_context()->get_value( $field_id )`. Both are in sync after `update_request`.
- **Save Record action** snapshots the request at submission end — values you write here will be in the saved submission.

If your action ALSO wants to pass non-field metadata to specific downstream actions (e.g. an internal API transaction ID, a calculated score), use `$handler->add_context_once( $this->get_id(), [...] )` instead. That's keyed by action type, not exposed as a form field, and accessible via `$handler->get_context( $action_type, $key )` in later actions.

## Step 6 — dispatch outcome events

Once you have the API result and have written it back, branch the chain by dispatching a custom event. Each branch can have its own followups (different actions wired to different events).

```php
use MyPlugin\Events\ApiSuccessEvent;
use MyPlugin\Events\ApiFailureEvent;

if ( $api_response['ok'] ?? false ) {
    jet_fb_events()->execute( ApiSuccessEvent::class, $handler->get_form_id() );
} else {
    jet_fb_events()->execute( ApiFailureEvent::class, $handler->get_form_id() );
}
```

Important caveats from observed production usage:

- **Save the action handler's position** before dispatching, restore after — the dispatch reuses the action handler and shifts its iteration cursor, which can confuse the surrounding chain:

```php
$previous_position = $handler->get_position();

try {
    jet_fb_events()->execute( $event_class, $handler->get_form_id() );
} finally {
    if ( $previous_position ) {
        $handler->set_current_action( $previous_position );
    } else {
        $handler->set_current_action( $this->_id );
    }
}
```

- **Pass the form ID** as the second argument. Some event executors need it.
- **Events must be registered** server-side via `'jet-form-builder/event-types'` filter (see `jfb-action-events`).
- **Listeners must opt-in** to the event in the editor — this is the standard `provideEvents` flow OR the action item decorator pattern (see `jfb-action-item-decorator`).

## Step 7 — credentials: read from settings tab, not constants

API keys and similar secrets should live in the plugin's settings tab (admin-managed, stored in `wp_options`). Don't hardcode, don't ship `wp-config.php` constants for plugin features — those are for the site owner.

```php
private function get_api_settings(): array {
    $defaults = array(
        'api_key' => '',
        'model'   => 'gpt-4',
        'enable_log' => false,
    );

    return array_merge(
        $defaults,
        Tab_Handler_Manager::instance()->options( 'myplugin-api-tab', array() )
    );
}
```

`Tab_Handler_Manager::instance()->options( $tab_id, $defaults )` reads the JFB settings tab's stored options — see `jfb-settings-tab` for how to register the tab itself. This pattern keeps the action code agnostic to where the credentials live, and makes it trivial for site admins to rotate keys.

## Step 8 — debug logging (gated)

Production actions called from form submissions can flood logs if you log indiscriminately. Gate logs behind a settings flag:

```php
private function should_log(): bool {
    static $enabled = null;
    if ( null !== $enabled ) {
        return $enabled;
    }
    $options = Tab_Handler_Manager::instance()->options( 'myplugin-api-tab', array() );
    $enabled = ! empty( $options['enable_log'] );
    return $enabled;
}

private function log( string $message ): void {
    if ( ! $this->should_log() ) {
        return;
    }
    error_log( '[MyPlugin] ' . $message );
}
```

The `static $enabled` cache avoids re-reading options on every log call within one request.

**What to log:**
- Request payload (sanitized — strip `Authorization` headers, redact secrets)
- API response status code and a short excerpt of the body
- Final outcome / decision

**What NOT to log:**
- API keys, tokens, full headers
- PII unless the user has opted in
- Full response bodies for high-volume endpoints

See `wp-security-secrets` for the full secrets-in-logs discussion.

## End-to-end example: complete `do_action()`

```php
/**
 * @throws Action_Exception
 */
public function do_action( array $request, Action_Handler $handler ) {
    // 1. Read settings (template + target field).
    $instructions = sanitize_textarea_field( $this->settings['instructions'] ?? '' );
    $target_field = Tools::sanitize_text_field( $this->settings['fields_map']['answer'] ?? '' );

    if ( '' === $target_field ) {
        throw new Action_Exception(
            __( 'Target field is required.', 'myplugin' )
        );
    }

    // 2. Macro-replace admin templates.
    $prompt = $this->replace_macros( $instructions );

    // 3. Call the API.
    $response = $this->call_external_api( array(
        'prompt' => $prompt,
        'model'  => $this->get_api_settings()['model'],
    ) );

    // 4. Sanitize + write the result back into form context.
    $answer = sanitize_textarea_field( $response['answer'] ?? '' );
    jet_fb_context()->update_request( $answer, $target_field );

    // 5. Dispatch outcome event.
    $previous_position = $handler->get_position();
    try {
        $event_class = ( $response['decision'] ?? false )
            ? \MyPlugin\Events\DecisionTrueEvent::class
            : \MyPlugin\Events\DecisionFalseEvent::class;

        jet_fb_events()->execute( $event_class, $handler->get_form_id() );
    } finally {
        if ( $previous_position ) {
            $handler->set_current_action( $previous_position );
        } else {
            $handler->set_current_action( $this->_id );
        }
    }
}
```

This shape — settings → macro → API → context write → event dispatch — covers the vast majority of integration actions. Most of the implementation effort is steering the API specifics; the JFB-side glue is constant.

## Critical rules

- **`jet_fb_context()` is the source of truth, not `$request`** — both work for reading, but if upstream actions might mutate, prefer `get_value`. For writes, ALWAYS use `update_request` (NOT direct array mutation).
- **`update_request( $value, $field_id )` argument order is value-first.** Easy to mix up.
- **Sanitize at the boundary** — even though JFB validates form fields, your action sends data to a different system with different rules. `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `absint`, `wp_kses_post` for HTML, `Tools::sanitize_text_field` for action settings.
- **Use `wp_remote_*` for HTTP, never `curl` / `file_get_contents` / `fopen` with URLs.** WP's HTTP API is the only correct path on multi-host environments.
- **Always set explicit `timeout`** — the default 5s breaks LLM and slow-CRM use cases.
- **Throw `Action_Exception` for failure**, never raw `Exception`. JFB only displays `Action_Exception` messages to the user.
- **Save and restore handler position around `jet_fb_events()->execute()`** — the dispatch shifts the iteration cursor.
- **API keys come from the settings tab via `Tab_Handler_Manager`** — never hardcode, never `wp-config.php` constants for plugin-feature credentials.
- **Gate `error_log` behind a settings flag** — production logs flood otherwise.
- **Strip secrets before logging** — `Authorization` headers, API keys, full bodies of auth-related endpoints.
- **Validate URL host for SSRF** when the URL is user-configurable — see `wp-security-deep`.
- **Macros come from `%field_id%`** — JFB field ID format. Don't invent your own delimiter; admins expect this convention.

## Common pitfalls (failure modes inferred from the API contract)

- **`update_request` writes nothing visible**: target field doesn't exist on the form. Verify with `has_field` first, OR document that the field is required.
- **Macro replacer eats `%`-signs in non-template text**: the regex matches greedily over `%foo%`. If your text legitimately contains percent characters, escape them in the admin help text (`100%%`) or use a different delimiter.
- **API call hangs the form submission for 30 seconds**: timeout is set, but the user is still waiting. Consider deferring slow calls to a background task (Action Scheduler) and dispatching events on completion. Out of scope here, but worth knowing.
- **Action throws on non-2xx, but the user only sees "Submit failed"**: `Action_Exception` was caught somewhere upstream OR a generic `\Exception` was thrown instead. Always use `Action_Exception` with a clear, translatable message.
- **`jet_fb_context()->get_value` returns null for a known field**: the form was submitted before that field was rendered (conditional block hid it). Use `??` to fall through to a default; do not throw.
- **Downstream actions don't see the updated value**: `update_request` was called with arguments swapped (`field_id` first, `value` second). Re-check argument order.
- **Event dispatched but no listener runs**: events not registered, OR listeners haven't opted-in via `provideEvents` / decorator. See `jfb-action-events`.
- **API key visible in error log**: logging the full request body without redaction. Add a redactor before the log call.

## Cross-references

- Run **`jfb-form-action`** first — this skill assumes a working action class with `action_attributes`, `action_data`, etc.
- Run **`jfb-action-events`** to register the events your action dispatches.
- Run **`jfb-action-item-decorator`** if you also want the visual TRUE/FALSE/Always toggle on every action (the canonical UI for action-event branching).
- Run **`jfb-settings-tab`** to register the settings tab where API credentials live.
- Run **`wp-security-deep`** for SSRF protection when API URLs are user-configurable.
- Run **`wp-security-secrets`** before release — credentials must come from the settings tab, never hardcoded.
- Run **`wp-i18n-audit`** to verify all error messages are translatable.

## What this skill does NOT cover

- Background / async API calls (Action Scheduler integration is a separate topic).
- Streaming API responses (Server-Sent Events, WebSocket) — out of scope.
- Multi-step API flows (OAuth, refresh tokens) — describe the storage of the refresh token, then this skill applies for each call.
- Idempotency keys / retries — depends on upstream API; not JFB-specific.
- File uploads from the form to an external API — possible but with different sanitization (`wp_check_filetype`, `wp_handle_upload` first).
- Rate limiting from your side — depends on the API; consider transients with TTL.
